# hmacdectiger
This project contains the prototype I quickly built for my Computer Science master thesis at TU Delft.

The output of this program is the top level joint policy of the H-MacDecTiger problem with a top level horizon of three.

In the output; 8 represents Hearing the tiger from the left, 9 represents hearing the tiger from the right.
Similarly, 0 represents opening the left door, 1 represents opening the right door, and 2 represents listening.

The prototype runs on a single thread, which allowed me to use the computer while this program was running.
A sideeffect however, is that the program takes around 5 hours to try all of the nearly 5 million joint top level policies on my laptop.
